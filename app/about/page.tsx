                  It is recorded that the first Seventh-day Adventist to enter
                  Uganda was E. C. Enns, a German missionary working at Suji in
                  the Pare region of Tanzania (then Tanganyika) who entered the
                  country from South Nyanza, Kenya in 1906. However, work did
                  not begin in Uganda until more than 20 years later, in 1927.
                  This long delay was most likely due to the local prevailing
                  political and religious unrest in the region.

                  Adventist missionaries entering Uganda found that it was
                  already zoned among Anglican Protestant missionaries, Catholic
                  missionaries, and Muslims. Accordingly, they were sent to
                  Nchwanga and were expected to fail because they were sent into
                  a disturbed area and the people of this area were naturally
                  suspicious of anything coming from Kampala and Buganda. By
                  providence, Adventists were able to establish a mission
                  station in Nchwanga in the year 1927.

                  The Seventh-day Adventist Church was banned by President Idi

                  was confiscated, and the government took over some of its
                  schools, converting them into public schools, which had a
                  negative impact on the Church and its operations in Uganda.
